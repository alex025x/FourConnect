**How to Play Button**
I have added a How to Play button, when this button is clicked on it opens up a pop-up explaining how the game works.

### Features Left to Implement

- Future updates could include a "play vs computer" mode.
- A line that goes through the winning tiles.
- Allow users to costumize their own tiles.
- Allow users to switch to dark mode if they wish.


## Testing

The project has undergone extensive testing to ensure that all features work as intended. The game has been tested on various browsers and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and compatibility.

### Validator Testing

- **HTML:** Passed through the official W3C validator with no errors.
- **CSS:** No errors found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.
- **JavaScript:** Passed through the official JSHint validator with no errors.

### Unfixed Bugs

Currently, there are no unfixed bugs in the project, and all features work as expected.

### Wireframe

There have been some changes since the wireframe was created. I initially intended on putting the display winner area beneath the buttons. However, as the project progressed, I thought it made more sense UX wise to have the display winner area above the game.
